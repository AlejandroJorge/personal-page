This is a test project. It's a simple Pokédex made with Astro and the PokéAPI. It's a project I made to practice my React skills. It's not finished yet, but it's functional. You can check the code in my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/AlejandroJorge/pokedex) and the demo in [Netlify](https://pokedex-project-astro.netlify.app/).
